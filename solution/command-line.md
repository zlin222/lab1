# Exercise 1: Navigation

This exercise is an introduction to terminal command.
An example solution is in the _solution_ folder.

Try to achieve the following tasks.  When done, write the command you
used in this file underneath the particular question.

1. Open your terminal (command prompt), either gitbash on windows or
   terminal on mac.

(cmd-t on mac, run gitbash on windows)

2. Which directory are you in?  Find it out!  Hint: `pwd`

```
pwd
```

(should print something like `/Users/otoomet` or `/c/Users/otoomet`)

3. Navigate to your "Documents" directory (or wherever else you keep
   your stuff).  Hint: `cd`
   
```
cd Documents
```
   
4. Print out the working directory--are you in the correct place?

```
pwd
```
(should print something like `/Users/otoomet/Documents`)

5. List the files there.  Do you see the same files and in the file
   explorer?  Hint: `ls`
   
```
ls
```
(you should see a bunch of files, and names should be the same you see
in file explorer)

6. Navigate back to the home folder.  Use the dedicated shortcut for
   home folder.  Hint `~`.
   
```
cd ~
```

7. Commit and push your changes.

```
git commit -am "cmd exercise done"
git push
```

8. Check the file on github--do you see your edits there?

(you should see your edits)

Congrats!  You are done!
