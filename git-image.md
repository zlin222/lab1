# Exercise 2: add image to git

This exercise asks you to add a folder to your repo, and thereafter
image to that folder.  And finally commit everything to github!

1. make a new folder (e.g. _images_) to this repo.  Hint: `mkdir`
   Yes.
   
2. ensure that the folder is there.  Hint: `ls`
   Images		git-image.md	readme.md
   command-line.md	license		solution

3. download an image you like and save it into the image dir you made
   above.
   ok.
   
4. on command line navigate to the image folder.  Hint: `cd`
   cd Images
   
5. ensure that the image is there.  Hint: `ls`
   1.jpg

6. add the image to your git repo.  Hint: `git add image.jpg`
   git add image.JPG

7. commit and push the changes.  Hint: `git commit -am ".. your
   message here.. ".
   git commit -am"add image file"
   git push
   
8. go and check on github that the image is there.
   Yes, is there.

9. as before, edit this file and write here the commands you used.
   Hint: you have to do the edits and commit again, in a similar
   fashion as above.
